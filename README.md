## Project Description
A simple Return on Investment (ROI) project. The user is asked a series of questions about a rental property they have invested in. Once all of the questions have been answered, the program prints a ROI receipt.

## How it Works
For example, the user may input the following data:

- Monthly income: $5000
- Water expense: $0
- HOA expense: $0
- Lawn expense: $0
- Vacancy expense: $0
- Repairs expense: $750
- CapEx expense: $100
- Property management expense: $1000
- Mortgage expense: $1500
- Misc fees expense: $150
- Tax expense total: $500
- Insurance expense total: $250
- Potential fees total: $100
- Down payment: $5000
- Closing cost: $25000
- Rehab budget: $2500

Given these inputs, the program may output the following:
